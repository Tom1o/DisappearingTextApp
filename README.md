<h1>Dissapearing Text App</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This app is a text editor, but if you stop typing for 5 seconds it deletes everything you typed. If you managed to fill the page it saves it. It's mostly a gimmick but could help with writers block.</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Just run the program to open the window, then start typing.</p>
